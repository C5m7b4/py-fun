    "## 🧑‍💻 Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome! We're excited to see how you think and code. This project is made up of several short, self-contained exercises split across multiple Jupyter notebooks. Each notebook explores a different set of skills ranging from basic Python to more advanced data wrangling and algorithmic challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🗂 Project Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "There are **4 notebooks** and **2 bonus notebooks** to complete:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `01-basics.ipynb` - python readiness prep\n",
    "2. `02-bootcamp.ipynb` - implement mean, mode, and median\n",
    "3. `03-pandas_fun.ipynb` - explore and improve a pandas DataFrame \n",
    "4. `04-list_comprehensions.ipynb` - one-liners, transformations, and mental gymnastics with list comprehensions\n",
    "5. `xtra_01_mse.ipynb` - Implement a core ML concepts MSE from scratch\n",
    "6. `xtra_02_r_quared.ipynb` - Implement a core ML concept R² from scratch\n",
    "7. `xtra_03_pearson_correlation.ipynb` - Implement a core ML concept Pearson Correlation from scratch\n",

    "## 🔀 What You Need to Do\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a new Git branch with your name**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git checkout -b your-name-here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Work through the exercises in each notebook. You can start from `01-basics.ipynb` and work your way up.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. You are encouraged to:\n",
    "   - Use markdown cells to explain your thinking\n",
    "   - Write clean and readable code\n",
    "   - Handle edge cases when appropriate\n",
    "   - Be curious — explore beyond the prompt if you feel inspired 🔥\n",
    "   - We are on a time limit so there will only be limited time for each exercise\n",
    "   - If you feel like you would be better at another example, feel free to skip exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "4. When you're done, push your branch to the repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git add .\n",
    "git commit -m \"Interview exercises completed by <your name>\"\n",
    "git push origin your-name-here\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "- Don’t worry if you don’t finish everything — quality > quantity\n",
    "- We’re more interested in how you think than whether you remember syntax\n",
    "- If you're unsure how to approach something, add a markdown cell and explain your thinking\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 Let's Go\n",
    "\n",
    "Open the first notebook: `01-basics.ipynb` and let the fun begin!\n",
    "\n",
    "Good luck, and may your imports always be clean and your bugs easily reproducible. 🐛💻\n"
